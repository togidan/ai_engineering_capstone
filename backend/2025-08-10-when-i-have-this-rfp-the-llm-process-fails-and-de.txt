● I'll analyze the RFP processing issue and examine how to make the LLM process more robust. Let me start
  by understanding the current implementation.

● Search(pattern: "LLM|openai|gpt", type: "py")
  ⎿  Found 70 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app/llm_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 197 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app/rfi.py)
  ⎿  Read 364 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Bash(cd backend && python -c "
      import os…)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> It's not an API error or whatever you're trying to do

● You're right, let me focus on analyzing the LLM robustness issue. Looking at the code, I can see several
  potential problems with the current LLM implementation:

● Search(pattern: "gpt-5-mini", path: "backend", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "model.*=", path: "backend/app/llm_service.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on my analysis of the code and the complex RFP you provided, I've identified several critical
  issues that are likely causing the LLM process to fail and fall back to regex parsing:

  Key Issues Identified:

  1. Invalid Model Name: The code uses "gpt-5-mini" which doesn't exist. This would cause API calls to fail
   immediately.
  2. Commented Out Critical Parameters: The temperature and max_completion_tokens are commented out, which
  could lead to inconsistent responses or token limit issues.
  3. Overly Complex Prompt: The current prompt is extremely detailed (190+ lines) and may be hitting
  context limits or causing the model to lose focus on the core task.
  4. Poor Error Handling: The system catches all exceptions generically, making it hard to diagnose why LLM
   calls are failing.
  5. Inadequate Logging: There's insufficient logging to understand where the LLM process breaks down.
  6. Missing Retry Logic: No retry mechanism for transient API failures.

  Root Cause Analysis for Your RFP:

  Your RFP is particularly complex with:
  - Multiple detailed sections (A-E) with specific requirements
  - Mixed data types (financial, technical, regulatory)
  - Specific numerical thresholds ($2.5B investment, 75+ acres, etc.)
  - Complex submission requirements

  The current prompt may be overwhelming the model with too many instructions, causing parsing failures.

> the model configuration works as expected, gpt 5 is new and the commented out portions are not required, 
  do not change it. I think chunking is a good idea and passing each related chunk, which should be chunked
   together by headers i think, should work. I think 1 retry is fine, but it shouldn't do more than that.

● You're absolutely right - thanks for the clarification on the model configuration. Based on your
  feedback, the key improvements should focus on:

  1. Header-based chunking - Parse the RFP by sections/headers to handle complex documents like yours
  2. Single retry logic - One retry attempt, not more
  3. Better error handling - More specific logging to understand failure modes

  Looking at your RFP, it has clear sections (1. Introduction, 2. Project Overview, 3. Scope of RFP
  Response with subsections A-E, etc.) that would benefit from chunking.
                                                                                                           
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Plan to Make LLM Process More Robust

    1. Implement Header-Based RFP Chunking

    - Add preprocessing to split RFP by headers/sections (numbered sections, lettered subsections)
    - Process each chunk separately with context about the overall RFP
    - Combine results from all chunks into final requirements table

    2. Add Single Retry Logic

    - Implement exactly 1 retry attempt on LLM failures
    - Use exponential backoff (brief delay) between attempts
    - Log retry attempts for debugging

    3. Improve Error Handling & Logging

    - Add specific error messages for different failure types (API errors, JSON parsing, validation)
    - Log chunk processing success/failure rates
    - Better diagnostic information when falling back to regex

    4. Optimize Chunked Processing

    - Maintain context between chunks (pass section info, previous requirements)
    - Handle cross-references between sections
    - Ensure consistent requirement ID numbering across chunks

    This approach should handle complex RFPs like yours that have multiple detailed sections, while keeping
     the processing manageable for the LLM.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Implement header-based RFP chunking functionality   
     ☒ Add single retry logic with exponential backoff
     ☒ Improve error handling and logging specificity
     ☒ Optimize chunked processing with context maintenance
     ☒ Test with the provided complex RFP

● Perfect! The implementation is complete and tested. Here's a summary of what I've implemented to make the
   LLM process more robust:

  ✅ Completed Improvements

  1. Header-Based RFP Chunking

  - Added intelligent parsing that splits large RFPs by sections (numbered, lettered, etc.)
  - Your complex RFP now gets chunked into 7 manageable sections instead of being processed as one
  overwhelming block
  - Each chunk is processed separately with focused prompts

  2. Single Retry Logic

  - Added exactly 1 retry attempt with 0.5-1 second delays as requested
  - Retry logic applies to both single-chunk and multi-chunk processing
  - No excessive retry attempts that could waste time/tokens

  3. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging

  - Added specific error messages for different failure types (JSON parsing, API errors, validation)
  - Better diagnostic information when falling back to regex parsing
  - Detailed logging of chunk processing success/failure rates

  4. Optimized Chunked Processing

  - Maintains context between chunks with section-specific prompts
  - Consistent requirement ID numbering across chunks
  - Combines results intelligently while preserving data integrity

  5. Tested with Your Complex RFP

  - Your RFP correctly splits into: Document Start → 1. Introduction → 2. Project Overview → 3. Scope → A.
  Site Info → B. Utilities → C. Workforce
  - All components integrated successfully

  Key Benefits for Your RFP:

  - Handles complexity: Your multi-section economic development RFP with detailed requirements is now
  processed in manageable chunks
  - Better parsing: Each section gets focused attention instead of being lost in a massive prompt
  - Resilient: Single retry attempts handle transient API issues without excessive delays
  - Informative: Detailed logging helps diagnose any remaining issues

  The system should now successfully process your complex RFP through the LLM instead of falling back to
  regex parsing.

> awesome. I want you to now break this whole projct down into a tasks list that can be split between two 
  junior developers. For each task, be sure to include the context, task, and milestone. If a task should 
  have subtasks, include those subtasks. Save the file as a task_list.md

● I'll analyze the entire project and create a comprehensive task breakdown for two junior developers.

     # City Opportunity MVP - Development Task List
     This document outlines the task breakdown for two junior developers working on the City Opportunity MVP
      application. The project is a dual-purpose application for city opportunity scoring and RFP workflow
     management.
     ## Project Context
     **Tech Stack:**
     - Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Chakra UI
     - Backend: FastAPI + Python + OpenAI GPT integration
     - Data: CSV files, JSON configuration, file processing (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
     … +229 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I've created a comprehensive task breakdown that divides the City Opportunity MVP project between two
  junior developers. Here's the structure:

  Developer A (Frontend Focus):

  - Task A1: City scoring system implementation
  - Task A2: RFP frontend interface development
  - Task A3: UI/UX polish and integration

  Developer B (Backend Focus):

  - Task B1: Core API infrastructure
  - Task B2: File processing system
  - Task B3: Advanced LLM integration (the improvements we just made)
  - Task B4: Data integration and testing

  Shared Integration:

  - Task I1: End-to-end integration and deployment

  Each task includes:
  - Context explaining the business purpose
  - Detailed subtasks breaking down the work
  - Specific files to work on
  - Clear milestones for completion criteria

  The breakdown accounts for the full project scope including the recent LLM robustness improvements,
  ensuring both developers have balanced workloads that build on each other's progress over a 4-week
  timeline.

> is this a format that can be pasted in for github issues to assign tasks?

● No, this format is designed as a comprehensive project breakdown document, not for individual GitHub
  issues. Let me create a GitHub-issue-friendly version with one task per issue that can be easily copied
  and pasted.

● Write(../github_issues.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 328 lines to ../github_issues.md                                                                
     # GitHub Issues for City Opportunity MVP
     Copy and paste each section below as a separate GitHub issue. Each issue is formatted for direct use in
      GitHub's issue creation interface.
     ---
     ## Issue #1: Frontend - City Data Loading and Scoring System
     **Labels:** `frontend`, `enhancement`, `priority-high`
     **Assignee:** Developer A
     … +318 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I've created a GitHub-issues-ready format. Each section can be copied and pasted directly into
  GitHub's issue creation interface. The new format includes:

  Key Features for GitHub Issues:

  ✅ Individual Issues - Each task is a separate, self-contained issue✅ GitHub Labels - Pre-defined labels
   like frontend, backend, enhancement✅ Assignee Field - Ready to assign to Developer A or B✅ Milestones
  - Week-based milestones for project tracking✅ Checkboxes - GitHub-compatible task lists with - [ ]✅
  Clear Acceptance Criteria - Specific, testable requirements✅ Definition of Done - Explicit completion
  criteria

  How to Use:

  1. Copy each issue section (from one --- to the next)
  2. Paste into GitHub's "New Issue" form
  3. Add the suggested labels from the Labels field
  4. Assign to the specified developer
  5. Set the milestone for project tracking

  Issue Breakdown:

  - 9 total issues split between developers
  - Developer A: 4 frontend-focused issues
  - Developer B: 4 backend-focused issues
  - 1 shared integration issue for both developers

  Each issue is sized appropriately for 1-2 weeks of work and includes all the context a junior developer
  would need to complete the task successfully.

> I'm good with user authentication, don't care for collaboration right now. Scanned documents don't matter
   for now, can come later. I think more immediately, we need more granular stuff like, an AI agent that 
  will go and read all the available files that an organization/user has uploaded, opens each file, and 
  checks if the relevant information for whatever it needs to search for is in the file. We also need an 
  agent that checks if the narrative of the RFP response makes a lot of sense. We need a pre-validation 
  method that checks for prompt injections that might be present in the RFP or data. We also need to build 
  evaluation metrics to make sure the agents are working well and doing the right thing. I think we can 
  implement the agents using langchain or langsmith. Let's start there and go ahead and put it as github 
  issues with different tasks to be split between two junior developers. give recommendations of whether or
   not a new file needs to be created or if it should go into an existing file.

● Perfect! You're focusing on the right areas - AI agents for intelligence gathering, quality assurance,
  and security. Let me analyze the current codebase structure and create GitHub issues for implementing
  these features with LangChain/LangSmith.

● Read(app)

● List(app)
  ⎿  Listed 13 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on your requirements and the current codebase structure, I'll create GitHub issues for implementing
   AI agents with LangChain/LangSmith. Here's my analysis and recommendations:

  Architecture Analysis

  Current Backend Structure:
  - app/llm_service.py - Basic OpenAI integration
  - app/file_service.py - File processing utilities
  - app/rfi.py - RFP processing endpoints
  - app/schemas.py - Pydantic models

  New Components Needed:
  - AI Agent framework with LangChain
  - Security validation service
  - Evaluation metrics system
  - Document intelligence service
                                                                                             
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  AI Agent Implementation Plan with GitHub Issues

     Core Features to Implement:

     1. Document Intelligence Agent: Scans all uploaded files to extract relevant information
     2. Narrative Quality Agent: Validates RFP response coherence and quality
     3. Security Validation Agent: Detects prompt injections and malicious content
     4. Evaluation Metrics System: Monitors and measures agent performance

     Technical Stack:

     - LangChain for agent orchestration
     - LangSmith for monitoring and evaluation
     - Enhanced security validation pipeline
     - Metrics collection and analysis

     File Structure Recommendations:

     - New files: app/agents/, app/security/, app/evaluation/
     - Enhanced existing: app/llm_service.py, app/rfi.py, requirements.txt

     Task Distribution:

     - Developer A: Document intelligence agent + evaluation metrics
     - Developer B: Security validation + narrative quality agent

     **Labels:** `backend`, `ai-agent`, `enhancement`, `priority-high`
     **Assignee:** Developer A
     … +373 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I've created comprehensive GitHub issues for implementing the AI agent features you requested. Here's
  what I've designed:

  Core AI Agents (4 main agents):

  Developer A Tasks:

  - Issue #10: Document Intelligence Agent - Scans all uploaded files, creates searchable index
  - Issue #13: Evaluation Metrics System - Monitors all agent performance with LangSmith
  - Issue #14: Agent Orchestration - Coordinates all agents working together
  - Issue #15: Frontend Integration - Display agent results and status

  Developer B Tasks:

  - Issue #11: Security Validation Agent - Priority Critical - Detects prompt injections
  - Issue #12: Narrative Quality Agent - Validates RFP response coherence and quality

  Key Architecture Decisions:

  New File Structure:

  app/agents/          # All AI agents
  app/security/        # Security validation system
  app/evaluation/      # Metrics and monitoring

  Enhanced Existing Files:

  - app/rfi.py - Orchestrate agents in processing pipeline
  - app/llm_service.py - Integrate with security pre-validation
  - requirements.txt - LangChain, LangSmith, security tools

  Security-First Approach:

  - Issue #11 (Security Agent) marked as Priority Critical
  - Must be completed first to prevent prompt injection attacks
  - Multi-layer validation before any LLM processing

  Comprehensive Evaluation:

  - LangSmith integration for real-time monitoring
  - Performance benchmarks for each agent
  - User feedback collection system
  - A/B testing framework for improvements

  Each issue includes specific acceptance criteria, file recommendations, implementation details, and clear
   dependencies. The security agent prevents prompt injections, the document agent finds relevant
  information across all files, the quality agent ensures professional responses, and the evaluation system
   ensures everything works reliably.
